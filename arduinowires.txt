/*
 This is an example of code that ECS leaders used to make 
 lights blink in four different ways with a pizza cart 
 (four lights on the umbrella). 
 Lights were attached to pins 2, 3, 10, and 9.
 We used the two button switches on the Circuit Playground 
 (connected to 4 & 19).

/*Below we say what each blinking pattern does using 
 "functions" or "procedures" in Arduino.
 - blinkingPattern1 turns each light on in turn, 
 and then goes backwards to turn each one off.
 (If we want this pattern to go faster or slower 
 we just change the value of "delaytime1" in the 
 NAMING SECTION at the top).
 - blinkingPattern2 blinks  all the lights on 
 and off
 - blinkingPattern3 turns all the lights on
 - Alloff turns all the lights off
